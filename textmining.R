##Tidying an Emily Dickinson quote.

#The unnest_tokens() function within the tidytext package breaks down text strings into components.
#These can be individual words,  characters, sentences, paragraphs or ngrams. It removes punctuation
#and - by default - also converts everything to lowercase.

#Tidying the works of Jane Austen
#
#This combines the unnest_tokens function with group_by() and mutate() to split out
#line and chapter numbers. str_detect() returns TRUE if there's a match, which increments 
#the cumsum() return value by 1. 
#
#regex() is used to create a new column containing the chapter number.
#It matches digits (//d) and also the roman numerals ivxlc. I think this is a
#standard pattern since no Jane Austen novel has 100+ chapters. In fact, none in
#this data set use roman numerals at all.
