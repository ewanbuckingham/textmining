#####n.b. This code asks ggplot to do something it can't do. Rank the words by term frequency and then plot
#####smoothly descending curves for each. That's not possible because some words are used more than others (i.e.
##### 'to' is not the most consistently used word. For some books it's 'the'. So the factor reorder doesn't work.)
#####I tried using both mutate(word = reorder(word, tf) and forecats::fct_re_order(word, tf) before realising.)
